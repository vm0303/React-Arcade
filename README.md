# React-Arcade
2 years ago, I did a project for my Web Development class where I had to implement 2  problem-solving games using React's drag and drop library. 
However, the library now uses hooks to use the drag and drop function, which was a bit complex for me to understand. So, I decided to re-invent 
that same project from 2 years by using Javascript's drag functions for the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. 

As for the Sliding Puzzle, I used React Motion to get the slide effect of a single tile in the board since we need to moves the tiles around to solve the puzzle.

Out of all the projects I have done so far, I personally like this one a lot becuase it's a lot more dynamic than the other projects I have done so far.
